The COVID-19 pandemic led to severe limitations in people\u2019s face-to-face interactions, resulting in most people relying more heavily on digital communication for social connection. Existing research has contributed to the understanding of how face-to-face communication is used alongside digital communication. However, we know little about what elements of face-to-face interactions people miss especially when in-person meetings are heavily reduced, and how this is related to their use of digital communication for social connection. In this study, we draw upon survey data that we collected in spring 2020 from a national sample of U. S. adults to answer these questions. We find that most people missed elements of face-to-face interactions and particularly valued spontaneous interactions, physical closeness, and independence from technology about in-person interactions. More frequent and increasing use of popular digital modes such as voice calls, video calls, text messages, and social media were all positively related to missing face-to-face communication. Our results contribute to the understanding of the role and value of in-person interactions in a digital world.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), in combination with adverse community environments, can result in traumatic stress reactions, increasing a person\u2019s risk for chronic physical and mental health conditions. Family resilience refers to the ability of families to withstand and rebound from adversity; it involves coping with disruptions as well as positive growth in the face of sudden or challenging life events, trauma, or adversities. This study aimed to identify factors contributing to family and community resilience from the perspective of families who self-identified as having a history of adversity and being resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This study used Photovoice, a visual participatory research method which asks participants to take photographs to illustrate their responses to a research question. Participants consisted of a maximum variation sample of families who demonstrated family level resilience in the context of the pair of ACEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Family members were asked to collect approximately five images or videos that illustrated the facilitators and barriers to well-being for their family in their community. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted using the SHOWeD framework to allow participants to share and elucidate the meaning of their photos. Using thematic analysis, two researchers then independently completed line-by-line coding of interview transcripts before collaborating to develop consensus regarding key themes and interpretations. Results Nine families were enrolled in the study. We identified five main themes that enhanced family resilience: (1) social support networks; (2) factors fostering children's development; (3) access and connection to nature; (4) having a space of one\u2019s own; and (5) access to social services and community resources. Conclusions In the context of additional stresses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resilient behaviours and strategies for families were identified. The creation or development of networks of intra- and inter-community bonds; the promotion of accessible parenting, housing, and other social services; and the conservation and expansion of natural environments may support resilience and health.",

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the \u201cInternational Public Health Emergency\u201d due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions have been imposed by countries to prevent the pandemic. With these restrictions, air traffic has come to a halt, only health, humanitarian, military, repatriation and cargo flights have been carried out. Due to the Covid-19, more than 6 million traffic losses occurred in the European air traffic network. There were 0.2 million flight losses in the 9/11 attacks and 0.8 million flight losses in the great financial crisis. It is not known how long the recovery will take to reach traffic data in 2019. In this study, the impact of Covid-19 on the European and Turkey air traffic networks in 2020 was analyzed compared to the 2019 data. Within the scope of forecasts published by aviation authorities, assessments regarding the recovery process are also included. It is predicted that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the air traffic networks will not be compensated for a long time in line with current data and predictions for the pandemic.",

                "abstract": "This paper assesses whether and to which extent the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a scenario of high moral intensity, is influencing the moral reasoning of top CEOs (chief executive officers) in the paradigmatic case of the automotive industry and how this moral reasoning relates to their CSR response to the crisis and their CSR plans in the long run. To this end, we took the CEO letters before and after the pandemic outbreak of the top 15 automotive companies, and applied Weber\u2019s method to conduct a moral reasoning categorization, along with an examination of their CSR approach and initiatives. The results show a predominant moral paralysis among these CEOs, where positive reactions addressed are philanthropic in nature and more likely to be a transient response to the crisis, rather than a sustained long-term improvement of their CSR rooted in a significant moral approach enhancement. Furthermore, CEOs at the lowest stages of moral reasoning, primarily focused on their own business and immediate stakeholders, are less likely to highlight these philanthropic initiatives. The outcome evidences the convenience of addressing CSR from the lens of moral reasoning, and it further draws the attention of the scientific community, companies and their top management, stakeholders, and society to the relevance of investigating and considering the moral reasoning of top management in large corporations and its implications.",

Sin embargo, aunque es un procedimiento no invasivo, es complejo y se asocia con eventos adversos como las \u00falceras por presi\u00f3n (UPP). Nuestro objetivo es proponer un plan de cuidados de enfermer\u00eda basado en el lenguaje estandarizado NANDA-I, NIC, NOC para la prevenci\u00f3n de las UPP secundarias a la PP en la enfermedad de COVID-19. S\u00edntesis del contenido: En los pacientes con COVID-19, adem\u00e1s de factores de riesgo propios del paciente como la edad avanzada y la presencia de comorbilidades, la PP contribuye a la presencia de los diagn\u00f3sticos de enfermer\u00eda de riesgo de \u00falcera por presi\u00f3n [00249], de deterioro de la integridad cut\u00e1nea [00047] y tisular [00248]. \u00a0Por su parte, la intervenci\u00f3n de enfermer\u00eda prevenci\u00f3n de \u00falceras por presi\u00f3n [3540], es clave para minimizar el desarrollo de esta complicaci\u00f3n, mejorar la calidad de la atenci\u00f3n y el pron\u00f3stico en este tipo de pacientes. Finalmente, para determinar la efectividad del cuidado de enfermer\u00eda se proponen los resultados NOC consecuencias de la inmovilidad: fisiol\u00f3gicas [0204] e integridad tisular: piel y membranas mucosas [1101].\u00a0Conclusi\u00f3n: La PP es una terapia coadyuvante\u00a0 recomendada para el manejo de los pacientes con COVID-19 cr\u00edticamente enfermos, debido a que optimiza la funci\u00f3n pulmonar, sin embargo est\u00e1 asociada a eventos adversos como las UPP. Este art\u00edculo presenta recomendaciones basadas en una revisi\u00f3n narrativa para facilitar la implementaci\u00f3n de cuidados de enfermer\u00eda preventivos que reduzcan su frecuencia en esta poblaci\u00f3n.\n\r\n\nC\u00f3mo citar este art\u00edculo: Rojas LZ, Mora Rico LA, Acosta Bar\u00f3n JV, Cristancho Zambrano LY, Valencia Bar\u00f3n YD, Hern\u00e1ndez Vargas JA.

                "abstract": "While the Covid-19 emergency has launched a widespread debate about the role of architecture, it is not the only health crisis to have impacted the 20th and 21st centuries. A survey of the leading Italian architectural magazines was performed to better understand how the design culture treated past pandemics, such as the Asian, Hong Kong, and Swine influenzas. Although the review did not reveal explicit reflections, some design constants in the planning of the city emerged cyclically in the background. This paper shows how, thanks to the debate on Covid-19, an incubation process that began a century ago is being completed, allowing only today the clarification of the media function of architecture in the construction of a critical awareness towards the pandemic phenomenon.",

                "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated dermatosis usually associated with comorbidities. Treatment varies from topicals to systemic drugs and data on susceptibility to viral infections in psoriatic patients are scarce. The objectives of this study were to analyze psoriatic patients on different therapies who were at risk for COVID-19 for seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, comorbidities and outcomes in order to unveil the immunological mechanisms involved in the anti-viral response in patients with psoriasis. Seventy-five patients with psoriasis were divided according to treatment: immunobiologics, methotrexate, topicals and acitretin. Twenty healthy controls were included. Plasma samples were collected for: IgG SARS-COV-2 (ELISA); IL-27, IL-29 and IL-18 (ELISA); and IL-1\u03b2, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNF (cytometric array). Seropositivity for SARS-COV-2 was detected in 24 out of 75 psoriasis patients and did not relate to COVID-19 symptoms and/or hospitalization, despite associated comorbidities. Psoriasis patients who were asymptomatic for SARS-COV-2 exhibited immune imbalance with high levels of IL-18, IL-17A and IL-6, and low levels of IL-27 compared to healthy controls. Psoriasis groups showed significant increased cytokine levels only in the group with immunobiologics. Despite immune deviations and lower IL-27, which has a potential antiviral impact, psoriatic patients did not exhibit complications related to COVID-19. An understanding of this kind of proinflammatory profile of psoriatic patients and of the lack of severe outcomes for COVID-19 is essential to establish novel therapeutic approaches and preventive measures, including with regard to the concomitance of viral infections.",

For this reason, this article examines tourist satisfaction during the peak tourist season of 2020 in a mature coastal destination in Catalonia in relation to safety and prevention measures imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We use explanatory factor analysis and partial least squares path modelling for comparing the determinants of tourist satisfaction prior and during the pandemic based on surveys conducted in 2019 (N = 1556) and 2020 (N = 2220). The results suggest that the determinants of overall tourist satisfaction in 2019 remained significant in 2020. Moreover, although tourists especially appreciated feeling safe in 2020, our results suggest that such a perception was unrelated to measures to prevent COVID-19. The paper raises concerns towards the management of situations such as the pandemic in tourist destinations, as a proper balance must be found between the need of making visitors feel safe, and avoiding measures that can be felt as invasive or annoying, hampering the tourist experience.

There were 257 (43.4%) parents would vaccinate their children. A high level of education of parents (p=0.022), a high monthly income of the family (p=0.006), and male gender (p=0.002) were associated with high willingness to vaccinate their children. Two hundred twenty two parents stated that their decision may change depending on whether the vaccine is of domestic or foreign origin, and 215 (96.85%) of them stated that they would prefer domestic vaccines. The most frequent reasons for vaccine hesitancy or refusal to their children were: fear of possible side effects and it being a foreign vaccine.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The hesitancy or refusal of parents to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine is high. Public health authorities should inform the public about the importance of vaccination and domestic vaccine production should be encouraged.",

Due to the many fraud incidents, corporate governance is vital in ensuring earnings persistence by considering many audit committee structures. Based on this phenomenon, the purpose of this study is to determine how significant the role of corporate governance is in overcoming earnings persistence moderated by the number of audit committees. This study is quantitative descriptive with a population of all companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Index (IDX), and the number of samples with several criteria found as many as six companies. This research period was conducted from 2011-2019. This result implies a positive influence on corporate governance moderated by the audit committee on earnings persistence. This led to point out that the power of corporate governance has a positive effect on earnings persistence.",

Although the precise scope and long-term effects of COVID-19 \r\nhave not yet been determined, industry analysts predict that some irreversible changes will occur in the future. SMMEs, which represent approximately 80% of licensed tourism and tourism-related businesses worldwide, were \r\nacutely affected by the crises. Tourism SMMEs have been more directly affected, as people who live in vulnerable communities who depend on tourism for their livelihoods have been adversely affected by the collapse of SMMEs. \r\nThis research investigated the recovery possibilities of tourism SMMEs from COVID-19 in the city of Polokwane in Limpopo province. This research adopted a qualitative approach with in-depth semi-structured interviews as a \r\ndata collection tool from 13 owners of tourism SMMEs registered in the Polokwane Local Municipality database, the inclusion condition for these SMMEs was that they should have been in operation for a minimum of five (5) \r\nyears and to have been formally registered with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission of South Africa (CIPC). The key findings of the study shows that tourism SMME owners believe that their businesses will recover to the state they were before COVID-19, though the recovery would be slow and that SMME owners are of the view that the recovery is subject to rooting out of corruption activities withing government. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of SMMEs resilience and recovery from pandemics and disasters.",

The functional role and mechanism (s) of transcriptional regulation of deregulated genes in COVID-19 remain largely unknown. In the present communication, reanalyzing publicly available gene expression data, we observed that 66 lncRNA and 5491 PCG were deregulated in more than one experimental condition. Combining our earlier published results and using different publicly available resources, it was observed that 72 deregulated lncRNA interacted with 3228 genes/proteins. Many targets of deregulated lncRNA could also interact with SARS-CoV-2 coded proteins, modulated by IFN treatment and identified in CRISPR screening to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of the deregulated lncRNA and PCG were targets of at least one of the transcription factors (TFs), interferon responsive factors (IRFs), signal transducer, and activator of transcription (STATs), NF\u03baB, MYC, and RELA/p65. Deregulated 1069 PCG was joint targets of lncRNA and TF. These joint targets are significantly enriched with pathways relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection indicating that joint regulation of PCG could be one of the mechanisms for deregulation. Over all this manuscript showed possible involvement of lncRNA and mechanisms of deregulation of PCG in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",

It was hypothesized that most of the practicing surgeons recognize specific practice aspects (compensation, call schedule, operating room availability, and provided support staff) as key factors in employment opportunity evaluation.\nDesign:. Cross-sectional survey study.\nSetting:. Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) practice surveys.\nParticipants:. All active Canadian members of the OTA were eligible to participate.\nMain Outcome Measurement:. A 50-question survey was sent through email to OTA members assessing physician, practice, and compensation metrics of Canadian orthopaedic traumatologists.\nResults:. Fifty-two of 113 Canadian OTA members participated giving a response rate of 46%. All surgeons worked in an academic practice, either for a university (83%) or community hospital (17%). Only 2% of surgeons have changed jobs in the last 5 years, and over 73% of surgeons maintain the same place of employment during their careers. Most had an available dedicated orthopaedic trauma operating room (73%). The majority indicated having residents (71%) and fellows (63%) as support staff. Many reported completing 300\u2013500 cases per year (42%), which decreased during COVID-19 for 50% of surgeons. The most common reported compensation was between $400,000 and $600,000 US dollars (25%) with many working 4\u20136 call shifts a month (48%) and 51\u201370 hours a week (48%).\nConclusion:. This study demonstrated the varying practice and physician economic variables currently in Canada. The identification and continued surveillance of these employment variables will allow for transparency in job market evaluation by applicants.\nLevel of Evidence:. Level V.",

                "abstract": "Abstract In epidemiology, the effective reproduction number R e $R_{e}$ is used to characterize the growth rate of an epidemic outbreak. If R e > 1 $R_{e} >1$ , the epidemic worsens, and if R e < 1 $R_{e}< 1$ , then it subsides and eventually dies out. In this paper, we investigate properties of R e $R_{e}$ for a modified SEIR model of COVID-19 in the city of Houston, TX USA, in which the population is divided into low-risk and high-risk subpopulations. The response of R e $R_{e}$ to two types of control measures (testing and distancing) applied to the two different subpopulations is characterized. A\u00a0nonlinear cost model is used for control measures, to include the effects of diminishing returns. Lowest-cost control combinations for reducing instantaneous R e $R_{e}$ to a given value are computed. We propose three types of heuristic strategies for mitigating COVID-19 that are targeted at reducing R e $R_{e}$ , and we exhibit the tradeoffs between strategy implementation costs and number of deaths. We also consider two variants of each type of strategy: basic strategies, which consider only the effects of controls on R e $R_{e}$ , without regard to subpopulation; and high-risk prioritizing strategies, which maximize control of the high-risk subpopulation. Results showed that of the three heuristic strategy types, the most cost-effective involved setting a target value for R e $R_{e}$ and applying sufficient controls to attain that target value. This heuristic led to strategies that begin with strict distancing of the entire population, later followed by increased testing. Strategies that maximize control on high-risk individuals were less cost-effective than basic strategies that emphasize reduction of the rate of spreading of the disease. The model shows that delaying the start of control measures past a certain point greatly worsens strategy outcomes. We conclude that the effective reproduction can be a valuable real-time indicator in determining cost-effective control strategies.",

Setting Four NHS out-patient breast cancer centres in Scotland. Participants Ninety-two women who had successfully completed primary treatment for breast cancer were screened for moderate levels of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). Forty-five were eligible (17 intervention and 28 control) and 34 completed 3-month follow-up (15 intervention and 21 control). Intervention Mini-AFTERc, a single brief (30\u00a0min) structured telephone discussion with a specialist breast cancer nurse (SBCN) trained to target the antecedents of FCR. Outcomes Feasibility and acceptability of Mini-AFTERc and the study design were assessed via recruitment, consent, retention rates, patient outcomes (measured at baseline, 2, 4, and 12\u00a0weeks), and post-study interviews with participants and SBCNs, which were guided by Normalisation Process Theory. Results Mini-AFTERc was acceptable to patients and SBCNs. SBCNs believe the implementation of Mini-AFTERc to be feasible and an extension of discussions that already happen routinely. SBCNs believe delivery, however, at the scale required would be challenging given current competing demands for their time. Recruitment was impacted by variability in the follow-up practices of cancer centres and COVID-19 lockdown. Consent and follow-up procedures worked well, and retention rates were high. Conclusions The study provided invaluable information about the potential challenges and solutions for testing the Mini-AFTERc intervention more widely where limiting high FCR levels is an important goal following recovery from primary breast cancer treatment.

Their symptoms are broad, affecting their physical functioning and, ultimately, their quality of life. Many of those individuals who develop long COVID, possibly from a mild COVID-19 infection, are in the 18\u201365 age group. This prolongation of malaise directly influences national workforce economies. Objectives: To summarise the commonly reported physical symptoms of long COVID in order to inform potential adjustments in healthcare for the employable population. Methods: The Embase, CINAHL, Medline, SCOPUS, and WHO COVID-19 databases were searched. The study selection process was based on the PRISMA guidelines. The extracted data were synthesised and presented narratively. Results: 7403 studies were accessed, comprising 60 cohort studies and 10 case series/studies, representing 289,213 patients who met our criteria. The most frequently reported physical symptoms were fatigue (92%), shortness of breath (SOB) (81.8%), muscle pain (43.6%), and joint pain (34.5%). Conclusions: The range of reported physical symptoms was broad and varied; the main ones being fatigue, breathlessness/SOB, and pain. Similarities observed between long COVID and other post-acute infection syndromes may help formulate protocols to manage and promote recovery for long COVID patients. Inconsistencies were evident, particularly with a lack of adherence to the standardised definitions of long COVID.",

To inform public health strategies and messages, we examined the level of student support of mask use in public spaces and school mask requirements, as well as factors associated with students\u2019 perspectives. Methods We used cross-sectional survey data from 42,767 adolescents attending 133 Canadian secondary schools that participated in the COMPASS study during the 2020/2021 school year. Multinomial regression models assessed support for i) wearing a mask in indoor public spaces and ii) schools requiring students to wear masks, in association with COVID-19 knowledge, concerns, and perceived risk. Results Wearing masks in indoor public spaces was supported by 81.9% of students; 8.7% were unsupportive and 9.4% were neutral/undecided. School mask requirements were supported by 67.8%, with 23.1% neutral and 9.1% unsupportive. More females supported mask wearing in public spaces (83.9% vs. 79.1%) and school mask requirements (70.8% vs. 63.5%) than males. Students had increased odds of supporting mask use in public spaces and school mask requirements if they reported concerns about their own or their family\u2019s health, had discussions regarding ways to prevent infection, perceived COVID-19 to be a risk to young people, and knew that signs are not always present in COVID-19 cases and that masks prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission if someone coughs. Conclusions During the year following the beginning of the pandemic, most students supported the required use of masks in schools and wearing masks in indoor public spaces. Improving knowledge around the effectiveness of masks appears likely to have the largest impact on mask support in adolescent populations among the factors studied.",

We adopt the data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the terrestrial flow of people between cities from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics database in two scales: cities from Brazil, without the North region, and from the S\u00e3o Paulo State. Grounded on the complex networks approach, and considering that the mobility network serves as a proxy for the SARS-CoV-2 spreading, the nodes and edges represent cities and flows, respectively. Network centrality measures such as strength and degree are ranked and compared to the list of cities, ordered according to the day that they confirmed the first case of COVID-19. The strength measure captures the cities with a higher vulnerability of receiving new cases. Besides, it follows the interiorization process of SARS-CoV-2 in the S\u00e3o Paulo State when the network flows are above specific thresholds. Some countryside cities such as Feira de Santana (Bahia State), Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (S\u00e3o Paulo State), and Caruaru (Pernambuco State) have strength comparable to states\u2019 capitals. Our analysis offers additional tools for understanding and decision support to inter-cities mobility interventions regarding the SARS-CoV-2 and other epidemics.",

                "abstract": "During the last decade and, particularly, from the restrictions on mobility brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, online and digital teaching is positioning itself as an alternative to face-to-face teaching. As of today, however, the soundness of this alternative teaching in terms of learning outcomes and students\u2019 success is not yet clear, even though it is particularly important, since it may determine future teaching plans, strategies and methodology. This article presents the results of a teaching research project analyzing the impact of active participation and face-to-face interaction of students on their performance from a quantitative approach. Through an empirical study carried out with several groups of university students in financial accounting over a four-year period, we analyze the effect of including face-to-face techniques of participation and teaching innovation on students\u2019 success and performance. The quantitative results indicate a significant improvement in all the indicators of the \u201cexperimental\u201d groups, compared to face-to-face standard teaching groups and streaming teaching groups. By enhancing active participation, better marks and performance are achieved, especially in the continuous evaluation system. The qualitative results, based on the opinion of the students, also indicate their preference for models of active participation and interaction, as well as their positive perception of the success of the initiative. The advantages derived from innovative face-to-face teaching are evidenced since it favors group interaction and active participation of the students, which are crucial elements for performance and academic success.",

In the Vocational School of Design, Modeling, and Building Information (DPIB), a Technical Drawing subject aims to prepare students to be skilled at drawing building construction. This research is a Classroom Action Research that aims to determine changes in the learning outcomes of class X students of DPIB skill competence using the demonstration method. This research was conducted in 3 stages: pre-cycle, Cycle I, and Cycle 2. The data analysis showed that at the pre-cycle stage, student learning outcomes only had an average score of 68.653, and 26 of 32 students completed learning. Next, student learning outcomes in the first cycle experienced a relatively high increase of 11%, with an average score of 80.4, with 28 students completed carrying out learning. Then, the test was continued in cycle II with several improvements. At this stage, student learning outcomes increased by 4% from cycle I, with an average score of 84, and 28 students completed learning. The demonstration method is proven effective in applying to Engineering Drawing subjects that are carried out remotely because it can improve student learning outcomes.\n",

We aimed to estimate the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of college students.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data on 419 first-year students (ages 18-20) at a large public university in North Carolina both before (October 2019-February 2020) and after (June/July 2020) the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. After evaluating descriptive data on mental health and stressors by students' demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between Covid-19 stressors (including work reductions, health, distanced learning difficulties and social isolation) and mental health symptoms and severity controlling for students' pre-pandemic mental health, psychosocial resources, and demographic characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>We found that the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety increased from 18.1% before the pandemic to 25.3% within four months after the pandemic began; and the prevalence of moderate-severe depression increased from 21.5% to 31.7%. White, female and sexual/gender minority (SGM) students were at highest risk of increases in anxiety symptoms. Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, female, and SGM students were at highest risk of increases in depression symptoms. General difficulties associated with distanced learning and social isolation contributed to the increases in both depression and anxiety symptoms. However, work reductions as well as Covid-19 diagnosis and hospitalization of oneself, family members or friends were not associated with increases in depression or anxiety symptoms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Colleges may be able to reduce the mental health consequences of Covid-19 by investing in resources to reduce difficulties with distance learning and reduce social isolation during the pandemic.",

The purpose of the study was to find out how the profile of the visitor of the rural area had changed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The quantitative survey with 1026 visitors was conducted and its results were analyzed within three main segments of visitors \u2013 groups with children, couples and the others (without children). The results of the research confirm the persisting fact \u2013 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand in tourism is shifting from urban areas to rural ones, but overall tourists in research rural area can benefit from the fact that it is a relatively small area and can get the best of both rural areas as well as of near cities in the area. Visiting rural areas is generally a shorter-term option for all visitors, which does not require long-term planning. The findings confirmed that rural areas are a great opportunity for domestic tourism. The results bring a deeper and actual insight into the consumer behaviour of tourists in rural areas and at the same time the findings show the possibilities for service quality improvement. Both can be beneficial for service providers as well as destination managers.",

This leads to the postponement of elective surgeries including the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The probabilistic rupture risk index (PRRI) recently showed its advantage over the diameter criterion in AAA rupture risk assessment. Its major improvement is in increased specificity and yet has the same sensitivity as the maximal diameter criterion. The objective of this study was to test the clinical applicability of the PRRI method in a quasi-prospective patient cohort study. Methods: Nineteen patients (fourteen males, five females) with intact AAA who were postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic were included in this study. The PRRI was calculated at the baseline via finite element method models. If a case was diagnosed as high risk (PRRI > 3%), the patient was offered priority in AAA intervention. Cases were followed until 10 September 2021 and a number of false positive and false negative cases were recorded. Results: Each case was assessed within 3 days. Priority in intervention was offered to two patients with high PRRI. There were four false positive cases and no false negative cases classified by PRRI. In three cases, the follow-up was very short to reach any conclusion. Conclusions: Integrating PRRI into clinical workflow is possible. Longitudinal validation of PRRI did not fail and may significantly decrease the false positive rate in AAA treatment.",

Patients discharged from the ICU post-COVID-19 pneumonitis may experience long-term morbidity related to their critical illness, the treatment for this and the ICU environment. The aim of this study was to characterize the cognitive, psychologic, and physical consequences of COVID-19 in patients admitted to the ICU and discharged alive.\nDESIGN:. Prospective cohort study.\nSETTING:. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) follow-up clinic at Tallaght University Hospital, a tertiary referral center with a 16-bed mixed medical-surgical ICU, including critical care physicians, a psychologist, a physiotherapist, and a research nurse.\nPATIENTS:. Patients who had been admitted to the ICU in our tertiary referral center with COVID-19 pneumonitis 6 months earlier.\nINTERVENTIONS:. None.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:. A total of 22 patients attended the 6-month PICS follow-up clinic following admission to ICU with COVID-19 pneumonitis. Mean grip strength was low at the 6-month follow-up at 24.1 pounds (sd 9.8) with a minimally active median metabolic equivalent (MET) of 970 METs/wk (interquartile range, 0\u20137,794 METs/wk). Only 59% of patients were independent with regard to their activities of daily living. Eight of 14 patients (57%) had returned to work by 6 months post-ICU discharge. Their mean Intensive Care Psychological Assessment Tool (IPAT) score was 6.6 (sd 4.6) with a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th Edition (PCL-5) score of 21.1 (sd 17.5) and a mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 24 (sd 8.4); suggestive of mild cognitive impairment. In a multivariable regression model, only Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was significantly independently associated with MoCA score as a cognitive PICS outcome (beta-coefficient, \u20131.6; se, 0.6; p = 0.04). None of the predictor variables were significantly independently associated with IPAT and PCL-5 as psychologic outcomes, nor with International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form as a physical PICS outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS:. In this single-center prospective cohort study, we found that patients have a high burden of physical and psychologic impairment at 6 months following ICU discharge post-COVID-19 pneumonitis; in many cases requiring specialist referrals for long-term input. We advocate for increased resources for this much needed follow-up multidisciplinary intervention for an ever-growing population of patients.",

Hence, this study examined the mediating role of sense of coherence (SOC) and resilience in the relation to COVID-19 stress and teachers\u2019 well-being (TWB). It recruited 836 teachers from Ethiopia\u2019s higher-education institutions, of which 630 (75.4%) were men and 206 (24.6%) were women, with a mean age of 32.81 years and a standard deviation of 6.42. Findings showed that COVID-19 stress negatively predicted SOC, resilience, and TWB and that SOC and resilience positively predicted TWB. It was concluded that SOC and resilience, both together and separately, mediated the relation between COVID-19 stress and TWB. These results were discussed alongside relevant literature, and the study is found to be valuable for practitioners and researchers who seek to improve well-being using SOC and resilience as resources across teaching professions.",

It is essential to know the time for each activity in a COVID-19 vaccination process for better management, especially during a pandemic. Thus, we conducted a time-motion study to identify activities that led to delayed/increased waiting time in an urban primary health center in Bhubaneswar, India. We observed 196 COVID-19 vaccine beneficiaries over one month (June 2021) from when they arrived at the vaccination center until they left the center. A data collection form and a Stopwatch were used to estimate the time taken for various activities involved in COVID-19 vaccine delivery. The time taken was expressed in mean and median. We also compared the time taken during the first and second doses using the Mann-Whitney U test. The total mean time spent at the vaccination center was 40:56\u2009\u00b1\u200920:52\u2009minutes. The activity that took the longest was \u2018waiting time in queue before vaccination\u2019, which was 34:22\u2009\u00b1\u200920:56\u2009min constituting 82% of the total time. The activity that took longer for the second dose than the first was the beneficiary verification in the Co-WIN portal with a median of 27\u2009seconds and 36\u2009seconds, respectively (p\u2009<\u2009.001). This study will help program managers formulate better strategies to improve the vaccination process making it more efficient.",

Additionally, the research question was whether PFT should be performed routinely in post-COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 39 patients with a history of COVID-19 6 months prior to the study were included in the study (Group I). Individuals were hospitalized or treated in the outpatients department. The control group (Group II) consisted of 39 healthy patients without a COVID-19 history. Each subject completed a questionnaire interview and underwent laboratory and pulmonary function examinations. Results: Six months after COVID-19 recovery, patients mainly complained about cough (46%, n = 18), shortness of breath (23%, n = 9), weakness (13%, n = 5), and memory/concentration disorders (8%, n = 3). In the group of patients complaining of persistent cough present 6 months after COVID-19, the following PFT parameters were decreased: FEV1, FVC, FRC, TLC, and DLCO (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in comparison with patients without this symptom. Conclusions: Persistent shortness of breath is not necessarily associated with pulmonary function impairment in patients 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hence it requires appropriate differential diagnosis. Patients with a cough persisting 6 months after the acute phase of COVID-19 may benefit from PFT.",

This study examined the impact of the pandemic on the intravitreal-injection practice in two academic centers in Italy along with the related medico-legal implications. A retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from 16 March 2020 to 14 March 2021 at the ophthalmological departments of University of Cagliari (SGD) and University Magna Gr\u00e6cia of Catanzaro (UMG) was conducted. The data collected between 16 March 2020 and 14 June 2020 (lockdown), 15 June 2020 and 13 September 2020 (unlock), and 14 September 2020 and 14 March 2021 (second wave) were compared with those of the same period of the previous year. Weekly data on the administered drug and the number and type of treated disease were collected and analyzed. During the lockdown, a drop of 59% at SGD (<i>p</i> < 0.00001) and 77% at UMG (<i>p</i> < 0.00001) in intravitreal injections was found. In the first year of the pandemic, the reduction in injections was approximately of 27% (<i>p</i> < 0.0008) and 38% (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) at SGD and UMG, respectively. The COVID-19-related containment measures and the health resources redistribution have led to a delay in the treatment of chronic diseases of the retina, prioritizing the undeferrable ones. The lack of management guidelines has conceived relevant ethical and medico-legal issues that need to be considered in future measures planning.",

Con el objetivo de validar la capacidad de dos pruebas r\u00e1pidas para detectar anticuerpos debido a la infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 en la Isla de la Juventud, Cuba, de abril a mayo de 2020, se realiz\u00f3 un estudio descriptivo de corte transversal de evaluaci\u00f3n de pruebas r\u00e1pidas: Wondfo (SARS-CoV-2 antibody test) y Lungene covid-19 IgG/IgM rapid test, en comparaci\u00f3n con la prueba de reacci\u00f3n en cadena de la polimerasa en tiempo real. Se construyeron dos muestras homog\u00e9neas de 250 cada una, determin\u00e1ndose indicadores de validaci\u00f3n. Se obtuvieron valores de sensibilidad de 6,6% y 8,3% respectivamente para cada prueba, mientras que la especificidad result\u00f3 superior para Wondfo (95%). Los valores predictivos positivos resultaron muy bajos, los negativos adecuados, superior en Lungene con el 94,8%. Los valores de raz\u00f3n de verosimilitud fueron clasificados como in\u00fatiles. En diferentes escenarios en cuanto a casos sintom\u00e1ticos, se alcanz\u00f3 sensibilidad del 50% en intervalo de 1 a 7 d\u00edas para Wondfo. El \u00e1rea bajo la curva ROC para Wondfo fue 0,50 (IC95%=0,46-0,55) y para Lungene 0,46 (IC95%=0,38-0,55). El \u00edndice kappa para Wondfo fue de 0,025 y 0,010 para Lungene. Las pruebas r\u00e1pidas exploradas mostraron muy baja sensibilidad, valor predictivo positivo y raz\u00f3n de verosimilitud inadecuada. La validez global de las pruebas no demostr\u00f3 un buen desempe\u00f1o diagn\u00f3stico, marcado por el valor del \u00e1rea bajo la curva ROC.",

Risk scores have been used as triggers for protocols that combine several interventions for early management of sepsis. This study tested the accuracy of the score SIRS, qSOFA, and NEWS in predicting outcomes, including mortality and bacterial infection, in patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We described 2,473 cases of COVID-19 admitted to the ED of the largest referral hospital for severe COVID-19 in Brazil during the pandemic. SIRS, qSOFA and NEWS scores showed a poor performance as prognostic scores. However, NEWS score had a high sensitivity to predict in-hospital death (0.851), early bacterial infection (0.851), and ICU admission (0.868), suggesting that it may be a good screening tool for severe cases of COVID-19, despite its low specificity.",

                "abstract": "The ongoing Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the global crisis of natural gas supply, particularly in Europe. During the winter season, major importers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), such as South Korea and Japan, were directly affected by fluctuating spot LNG prices. This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) to predict the Japan Korea Marker (JKM), a spot LNG price index, to reduce price fluctuation risks for LNG importers such as the Korean Gas Corporation (KOGAS). Hence, price prediction models were developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, which were used for time series data prediction. Eighty-seven variables were collected for JKM prediction, of which eight were selected for modeling. Four scenarios (scenarios A, B, C, and D) were devised and tested to analyze the effect of each variable on the performance of the models. Among the eight variables, JKM, national balancing point (NBP), and Brent price indexes demonstrated the largest effects on the performance of the ML models. In contrast, the variable of LNG import volume in China had the least effect. The LSTM model showed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.195, making it the best-performing algorithm. However, the LSTM model demonstrated a decreased in performance of at least 57% during the COVID-19 period, which raises concerns regarding the reliability of the test results obtained during that time. The study compared the ML models\u2019 prediction performances with those of the traditional statistical model, autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA), to verify their effectiveness. The comparison results showed that the LSTM model\u2019s performance deviated by an MAE of 15\u201322%, which can be attributed to the constraints of the small dataset size and conceptual structural differences between the ML and ARIMA models. However, if a sufficiently large dataset can be secured for training, the ML model is expected to perform better than the ARIMA. Additionally, separate tests were conducted to predict the trends of JKM fluctuations and comprehensively validate the practicality of the ML models. Based on the test results, LSTM model, identified as the optimal ML algorithm, achieved a performance of 53% during the regular period and 57% d during the abnormal period (i.e., COVID-19). Subject matter experts agreed that the performance of the ML models could be improved through additional studies, ultimately reducing the risk of price fluctuations when purchasing spot LNG.",

This study examined the pre-service teachers' hopes, goals, hindrances, and solutions regarding the forced digital revolution of course learning. It encompasses strategies for students to cope with the reconceptualization and proactively manage knowledge acquisition in the face of a disease outbreak. The researchers employed a non-probability sampling technique in selecting the unit of analysis. For this qualitative investigation, the study employed summative content analysis to examine how words or passages of pre-service teachers operate within the context of their experience. Fifty learning modules from the first year of pre-service teachers were analyzed through document reviews. Based on the findings, this study enables the educational sector to visualize the configurations and problems that the students encountered during the pandemic. The pre-service teachers could hope to gain in-depth knowledge, have fun and engaging activities, and apply their learning to the real-world setting. Personal growth, becoming an effective teacher, and building connections among peers are what they have desired while embarking on their academic endeavors. As they faced multiple impediments, they became resourceful and found alternatives, asked for assistance from their peers, and reached out to their professors to gain in-depth knowledge about their pedagogy. The COVID-19 virus has substantially affected pre-service teachers' learning; however, empowering one another through online peer collaboration is a prime source of consolation for students who suffer during these rough times. The university should function as a center for students' holistic development and create a conducive, flexible learning environment that will allow students to flourish despite digital experiments. As a result, solutions conspired to alter tribulations into resolutions, and scholars' strategies aid them in confounding the detriments of distance education.&nbsp;",

                "abstract": "Background Ongoing exercise intolerance of unclear cause following COVID\u201019 infection is well recognized but poorly understood. We investigated exercise capacity in patients previously hospitalized with COVID\u201019 with and without self\u2010reported exercise intolerance using magnetic resonance\u2013augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Methods and Results Sixty subjects were enrolled in this single\u2010center prospective observational case\u2010control study, split into 3 equally sized groups: 2 groups of age\u2010, sex\u2010, and comorbidity\u2010matched previously hospitalized patients following COVID\u201019 without clearly identifiable postviral complications and with either self\u2010reported reduced (COVIDreduced) or fully recovered (COVIDnormal) exercise capacity; a group of age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched healthy controls. The COVIDreducedgroup had the lowest peak workload (79W [Interquartile range (IQR), 65\u2013100] versus controls 104W [IQR, 86\u2013148]; P=0.01) and shortest exercise duration (13.3\u00b12.8\u00a0minutes versus controls 16.6\u00b13.5\u00a0minutes; P=0.008), with no differences in these parameters between COVIDnormal patients and controls. The COVIDreduced group had: (1) the lowest peak indexed oxygen uptake (14.9\u00a0mL/minper kg [IQR, 13.1\u201316.2]) versus controls (22.3\u00a0mL/min per kg [IQR, 16.9\u201327.6]; P=0.003) and COVIDnormal patients (19.1\u00a0mL/min per kg [IQR, 15.4\u201323.7]; P=0.04); (2) the lowest peak indexed cardiac output (4.7\u00b11.2\u00a0L/min per m2) versus controls (6.0\u00b11.2\u00a0L/min per m2; P=0.004) and COVIDnormal patients (5.7\u00b11.5\u00a0L/min per m2; P=0.02), associated with lower indexed stroke volume (SVi:COVIDreduced 39\u00b110\u00a0mL/min per m2 versus COVIDnormal 43\u00b17\u00a0mL/min per m2 versus controls 48\u00b110\u00a0mL/min per m2; P=0.02). There were no differences in peak tissue oxygen extraction or biventricular ejection fractions between groups. There were no associations between COVID\u201019 illness severity and peak magnetic resonance\u2013augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing metrics. Peak indexed oxygen uptake, indexed cardiac output, and indexed stroke volume all correlated with duration from discharge to magnetic resonance\u2013augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing (P<0.05). Conclusions Magnetic resonance\u2013augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing suggests failure to augment stroke volume as a potential mechanism of exercise intolerance in previously hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019. This is unrelated to disease severity and, reassuringly, improves with time from acute illness.",

                "abstract": "IntroductionThe ubiquity of online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic induced the widespread use of videoconferencing applications. However, the prolonged use of these applications can lead to videoconferencing fatigue. Drawing from an online survey sample of 215 senior high school students from a selected private university in Manila, Philippines, this mixed methods study examines videoconferencing fatigue and its relationship with online student engagement (OSE) during the COVID-19 pandemic.Materials and methodsThis study utilized a convergent triangulation research design. The quantitative strand was cross-sectional in nature. The constructs were measured using the Zoom Exhaustion and Fatigue Scale and Online Student Engagement Scale. Bivariate and multivariate statistical tests were used to determine the significance of the relationships between variables. The qualitative strand utilized a descriptive design. Narrative data were collected through an open-ended survey question and analyzed using content analysis.ResultsQuantitative results indicate moderate to high levels of videoconferencing fatigue among student respondents. Moreover, higher levels of OSE were observed among those who endured higher visual fatigue and attended videoconferences more days a week. Qualitative findings demonstrate various manifestations of videoconferencing fatigue among students and relate it with decreased energy to perform academic tasks and learning absorption. However, the qualitative analysis also reveals students\u2019 perceived need for videoconferencing to learn online.DiscussionThe nuanced insights from both strands highlight that despite their perceived negative impacts of videoconferencing, students had to tolerate visual videoconferencing fatigue in order to engage meaningfully in online classes.",

                "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic which started in China in 2019, was originally described as a public health emergency of intercontinental concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. Due to its speedy rate of spread, the WHO then declared it a pandemic after 6 weeks. The global spread of COVID-19 has been attributed to the high mobility between and within countries. Having noted the wide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost every country affected, developed strict and restrictive public health measures to control the spread of the virus. Such measures included restrictions on country borders and social gatherings. Hence, the main purpose of the paper was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in relation to religion, health and poverty in Harare urban communities as well as determining solutions to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those sectors. The research methodology was qualitative in nature. Primary data were collected through in-depth telephone interviews and online open-ended questionnaires. Purposive sampling was used to select the study participants. The findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic triggered and exposed the inequalities in health. The pandemic also had a strong impact on religious activities and it exacerbated poverty levels as well. Those who had all the access to medication, food and vaccinations during the height of COVID-19 may not fully appreciate the impact that poverty coupled with pandemics left on their communities both religiously and socially. Malnutrition, hunger and sickness were the order of the day among the poor.\n\nContribution:\u00a0The conclusion was that COVID-19 negatively impacted on the health, religious and social sectors. Therefore, it is critical to maintain preventive and curative services, especially for the most vulnerable populations such as children, older persons, and people with disabilities.",

                "abstract": "This article investigates the valuation of artworks during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how art market participants employ fictional expectations of the future to stabilize valuations during uncertain times. A total of 86 forecasts originating from both the center and periphery of the global art market were analyzed. Taking a meta-analytic approach, focus was placed on what each analysis predicts, how it constructs the future it purports to know, and how the expected value of artworks and methods for their purchase are justified. This uncovered the paradoxical reality of art market forecasts\u2014their authors are convinced that the power of crisis could reformulate the art market, but their conclusions do not assume the possibility of real change. Further, the argument is made that speculation about the future is at the core of today\u2019s art economy. Therefore, in a crisis, market participants conservatively orient themselves toward artworks that already have established value.",

                "abstract": "Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is a severe relapsing disease requiring inpatient treatment, with clinical pattern including the features of anaphylaxis. The article presents diagnostic criteria aimed for differentiation of MCAS from similar severe conditions as well as discusses local forms of mast cell activation. The consensus group has established distinct criteria for diagnosing MCAS. The agreed criteria include episodic (recurrent) occurrence of typical systemic symptoms caused by release of mast cell mediators and involve, at least, two organs; an increase in serum tryptase level by, at least, 20% over individual baseline tryptase plus\u00a0 2 ng/mL tryptase during 3-4 hours of the pathological reaction; a positive response to drugs that either target mast cells mediators, or their effects. In principle, the classification of MCAS is based on its etiology being subdivided into primary (clonal) MCAS, secondary MCAS, and idiopathic MCAS. The primary MCAS is determined by clonal expansion of mast cells and is considered systemic mastocytosis. In secondary MCAS, normal mast cells are activated by the known triggers, e.g., IgE. If neither clonal expansion nor a trigger for mast cells activation are identified, the condition is defined as idiopathic MCAS.The new COVID-19 infection has attracted particular interest in MCAS, since the severe course of COVID-19 was thought to develop due to latent MCAS, but the criteria for MCAS in these patients were not reproduced. In the presence of local symptoms, such as urticaria, or in cases of single-organ involvement, e.g., isolated gastrointestinal symptoms, and suspected mast cell activation being basic to pathogenesis, the term mast cell activation disorder was introduced. Moreover, the article discusses several different mediators that are proposed as markers in the diagnosis of MCAS.However, over-diagnosis of MCAS entails the risk of missing the underlying pathology, which is not associated with MCAS, and requires differential diagnosis with a number of diseases. In the absence of severe attacks (with hypotension and shock), the likelihood of MCAS is generally very low. Of course, the patients with mastocytosis and/or confirmed IgE-dependent allergy are at higher risk of developing MCAS, but a\u00a0\u00a0 key diagnostic marker is an event-related increase in mast cells tryptase from baseline determined over the asymptomatic period. The diagnosis of MCAS is highly likely if the tryptase level rises above a certain threshold (20% of baseline plus 2 ng/mL).",

                "abstract": "Night-time light (NTL) data have been widely used as a remote proxy for the economic performance of regions. The use of these data is more advantageous than the traditional census approach is due to its timeliness, low cost, and comparability between regions and countries. Several recent studies have explored monthly NTL composites produced by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and revealed a dimming of the light in some countries during the national lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we explicitly tested the extent to which the observed decrease in the amount of NTL is associated with the economic recession at the subnational level. Specifically, we explore how the association between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the amount of NTL is modulated by the pandemic and whether NTL data can still serve as a sufficiently reliable proxy for the economic performance of regions even during stressful pandemic periods. For this reason, we use the states of the US and quarterly periods within 2014\u20132021 as a case study. We start with building a linear mixed effects model linking the state-level quarterly GDPs with the corresponding pre-processed NTL data, additionally controlling only for a long-term trends and seasonal fluctuations. We intentionally do not include other socio-economic predictors, such as population density and structure, in the model, aiming to observe the \u2018pure\u2019 explanatory potential of NTL. As it is built only for the pre-COVID-19 period, this model demonstrates a rather good performance, with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.60, while its extension across the whole period (2014\u20132021) leads to a considerable worsening of this (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42), suggesting that not accounting for the COVID-19 phenomenon substantially weakens the \u2018natural\u2019 GDP\u2013NTL association. At the same time, the model\u2019s enrichment with COVID-19 dummies restores the model fit to R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62. As a plausible application, we estimated the state-level economic losses by comparing actual GDPs in the pandemic period with the corresponding predictions generated by the pre-COVID-19 model. The states\u2019 vulnerability to the crisis varied from ~8 to ~18% (measured as a fraction of the pre-pandemic GDP level in the 4th quarter of 2019), with the largest losses being observed in states with a relatively low pre-pandemic GDP per capita, a low number of remote jobs, and a higher minority ratio.",

Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in northwest Amhara referral hospitals.Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th September to 20th October 2020. A total of 302 nurses were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered into EpiData version 3 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A binary logistic regression model was used to compute bivariable and multivariable analyses.Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses was 69.6%, 55.3%, and 20.5%, respectively. Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety. Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression. Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing stress.Conclusion: More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively. It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health. The government shall develop and implement national programs for occupational health and safety, prevent violence in the workplace, improve psychological well-being, and protect from physical and biological hazards to take care of the mental health of healthcare professionals during this pandemic.Keywords: anxiety, COVID-19, depression, stress, nurses",

The questionnaire was developed by knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) theory. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis.Results: A total of 3180 nursing students and interns (effective rate: 99.8%) from six Chinese provinces were polled. The vaccine hesitation rate was 9.65% (307/3180), 2230 participants (70.1%) had gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, and 643 participants (67.7%) had indicated a readiness to be vaccinated. The results showed that older age, higher academic background, perfect vaccine management, others\u2019 recommendations, influenza vaccination history, epidemic under control, knowledge of vaccines or intervals, and vaccine knowledge training were associated with higher vaccination rates. Conversely, vaccine hesitancy was caused by a perceived lack of physical need, uncertainty about vaccination requirements, and fear of vaccination.Conclusion: This study provided population-based estimates of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intention among mainland Chinese nursing students and interns. Factors such as age, education, vaccine knowledge, and attitudes influence COVID-19 vaccine behaviour. Relevant authorities should understand the barriers to COVID-19 vaccination from knowledge, attitude and practice, which is significant for formulating effective response strategies in future global public health crises.Graphical Abstract: Keywords: COVID-19, vaccine, knowledge, attitudes, practice, nursing students and interns",

Some reports have demonstrated conflicting results. We performed a robust, ecologic analysis comparing COVID-19 related mortality (CRM) between strictly selected countries based on BCG vaccination program status utilizing publicly available databases and machine learning methods to define the association between active BCG vaccination programs and CRM. Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. CRM was lower for the majority of countries with a BCG vaccination policy for at least the preceding 15\u00a0years (BCG15). CRM increased significantly for each increase in the percent population over age 65. A higher total population of a country and BCG15 were significantly associated with improved CRM. There was a consistent association between countries with a BCG vaccination for the preceding 15\u00a0years, but not other vaccination programs, and CRM. BCG vaccination programs continued to be associated with decreased CRM even for populations\u2009<\u200940\u00a0years old where CRM events are less frequent.",

We performed in silico analysis to search for novel immunogenic and antigenic peptides. A total of twenty-five peptides were preliminarily selected, located in the 3D structure of both proteins. Finally, eight peptides were selected: one located in the N protein and seven in the S1 domain of the spike protein. Additionally, the localization of selected peptides in 2D structures and possible changes in the sequences of these peptides in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were analyzed. All peptides were synthetized in MAP8 format, and recombinant S (trimer and RBD) and N proteins were used as antigens to search for antibodies in serum samples derived from COVID-19 patients, and for antibody response in New Zealand rabbits. Results showed high recognition of the serum derived from COVID-19 patients to all selected peptides; however, only the RBD3 peptide induced antibody production. In conclusion, this work provides evidence for a new strategy in peptide selection and its use for antibody detection or antibody production in animals.",

One of the most exposed groups to the virus and its psychosocial consequences is the healthcare workers, due to their implication in caring for affected people. Health workers are exposed to a fast and unpredictable situation that requires more human resources and materials than usual, however, the lack of means on account to this situation entails an increased probability of suffering different consequences, including the burnout syndrome, to which, generally, this professionals are already vulnerable. In addition, quarantine is added as a measure to prevent the spread of the pandemic, which is another handicap for healthcare workers. Quarantine means these professionals are more likely to suffer the foreseeable psychological consequences in general population, specifically, it has been observed that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent, because of the stress load of the situation experienced.",

O objetivo desta pesquisa foi analisar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica, por meio de uma revis\u00e3o sistem\u00e1tica, sobre o impacto da pandemia no bem-estar do professor universit\u00e1rio. Ap\u00f3s a busca por artigos em bases de dados, crit\u00e9rios de exclus\u00e3o foram aplicados e restaram 42 artigos cient\u00edficos para an\u00e1lise. A maioria dos artigos cient\u00edficos est\u00e1 escrito em ingl\u00eas e adv\u00e9m dos Estados Unidos, assim como, possuem abordagem quantitativa. Os resultados demonstraram que houve mais, em n\u00famero e intensidade, desafios e dificuldades observados do que benef\u00edcios e oportunidades.

A rede de apoio profissional e familiar foi citada como um benef\u00edcio durante a pandemia, e quando n\u00e3o percebida, como uma dificuldade. No que tange aos desafios, professores precisaram reformular suas aulas, metodologias de ensino, adaptar-se \u00e0s tecnologias e engajar os alunos, o que aumentou a carga de trabalho significativamente. Por fim, apresentam-se informa\u00e7\u00f5es necess\u00e1rias para que Institui\u00e7\u00f5es de Ensino Superior possam desenvolver pol\u00edticas que ajudem os professores a enfrentarem esses desafios, em busca da manuten\u00e7\u00e3o ou melhoria da qualidade do ensino superior.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel corinavirus (later named SARS-CoV-2 virus), was\u00a0fistly reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China towards the end of 2019. Large-scale spread within China and internationally led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30th January 2020. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death. There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections. Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue, has inhibitory effects on animal and human highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, in in vitro and in vivo experiments. It is also inhibitory against the COVID-19 virus in vitro. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in adult patients with severe COVID-19. Methods The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Adults (\u2265\u200918 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 virus infection, severe pneumonia signs or symptoms, and radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenously administered remdesivir or placebo for 10 days. The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital. One interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted once half of the total number of events required has been observed. Discussion This is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial in COVID-19. Enrolment began in sites in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 6th February 2020. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT04257656. Registered on 6 February 2020.",

                "abstract": "Background: It is important to know if mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients has changed as the pandemic has progressed. The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics over time of mortality among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Sweden, using nationwide data compiled by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Methods: Observational cohort study where all patients hospitalised in Sweden between March 1 and September 30, 2020, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity 14 days before to 5 days after admission and a discharge code for COVID-19 were included. Outcome was 60-day all-cause mortality. Patients were categorised according to month of hospital admission. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of death by month of admission, adjusting for, age, sex, comorbidities, care dependency, country of birth, healthcare region, and Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3 (patients in intensive care units; ICU). Findings: A total of 17,140 patients were included, of which 2943 died within 60 days of admission. The overall 60-day mortality was thus 17\u00b72% (95% CI, 16\u00b76%-17\u00b77%), and it decreased from 24\u00b77% (95% CI, 23\u00b70%-26\u00b75%) in March to 10\u00b74% (95% CI, 8\u00b79%-12\u00b71%) post-wave (July-September). Adjusted relative risk (RR) of death was 0\u00b746 (95% CI, 0\u00b739\u20130\u00b754) post-wave, using March as reference. Corresponding RR for patients not admitted to ICU and those admitted to ICU were 0\u00b749 (95% CI, 0\u00b742\u20130\u00b759) and 0\u00b749 (95% CI, 0\u00b733\u20130\u00b772), respectively. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU decreased from 19\u00b74% (95% CI, 17\u00b79%-21\u00b71%) in the March cohort to 8\u00b79% (95% CI, 7\u00b75%-10\u00b76%) post-wave. Interpretation: There was a gradual decline in mortality during the spring of 2020 in Swedish hospitalised COVID-19 patients, independent of baseline patient characteristics. Future research is needed to explain the reasons for this decline. The changing COVID-19 mortality should be taken into account when management and results of studies from the first pandemic wave are evaluated. Funding: This study was funded by Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare.",

                "abstract": "The occurrence of a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), quickly became a global threat after it had spread across the continents in just a few months. Over the next three years, it caused infections in over 646.6 million people and resulted in over 6.6 million deaths. As a novel disease, Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) became the subject of intensive research. Due to various clinical manifestations of the infection with possible fatal outcomes, it became evident that a finer understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and complications is necessary. Investigation of acute-phase reaction as a component of the immune system response to infection can be very helpful. Serum amyloid A (SAA) was investigated for this purpose as one of the acute-phase reactants primarily synthesized by the hepatocytes in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been found that elevated SAA levels were independent factors for gastrointestinal manifestations and liver injury during COVID-19 but also one of the factors in COVID19-associated coagulopathy. Studies showed that SAA levels positively correlate with disease severity and prognosis. Patients with severe infection demonstrated significantly higher levels of SAA. Higher SAA levels were observed in COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, and obesity, all recognized as independent risk factors for critical disease and poor prognosis. Patients with COVID-19 who died had higher levels of SAA than survivors. This short review will summarize current studies and knowledge about SSA in COVID-19, its role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its clinical usefulness in COVID-19 patients.",

Understanding how they dealt with the diagnostic of a stigmatized disease amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential repercussions, may enable healthcare professionals to of life. Thus, this study is aimed at understanding the perception of women about the discovery of breast cancer and the impact of the disease on their lives. <h4>Methods</h4> A qualitative study, with the participation of forty women with breast cancer, under chemotherapy treatment. It was performed in a hospital specialized in oncology, in Juiz de Fora, Brazil, in 2020 and 2021. Data collection was carried out with semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed with Bardin Content Analysis. <h4>Results</h4> Based on the central theme \"Discovery of the disease\", these categories were developed: \"Discovery\" and \"Impact of the disease\". A large part of women noticed a change in the breast, even before routine checks. Upon the impact of cancer diagnosis, negative feelings arise, then going through a process of acceptance and coping. Some barriers were faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused delays in the diagnostic and impact caused by social isolation. Family, friends, and healthcare professionals integrated an important supporting network in order to help coping with the disease. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The consequences of a breast cancer diagnosis can be devastating. It is necessary that healthcare professionals know and embrace the feelings, beliefs, and values as a part of the aspects related to health. Valuing the supporting network of women suffering from the disease may favor the process of accepting and coping with the neoplasm. The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighted as an obstacle to be overcome specially when it comes to diagnostic assistance and availability of a support network. In that sense, it is worth mentioning the importance of a healthcare team able to offer full assistance, with quality. The need of further studies to determine the impact of the pandemic in the long run.",

Remote learning in medical education has been described in the literature mostly in the context of local in-country teaching. International remote medical education poses unique challenges for educators, especially in low-middle income countries (LMICs) who need continued Emergency Medicine (EM) specialty development. Our objective is to describe the development and implementation of our remote educational curriculum for EM trainees in West Bengal, India, and to assess trainee satisfaction with our remote learning curriculum. Methods Our curriculum was developed by adapting remote learning techniques used in Western post-graduate medical education, conducting literature searches on remote learning modalities, and through collaboration with local faculty in India. We assessed resident satisfaction in our curriculum with feedback surveys and group discussions. Results The remote educational curriculum had overall high trainee satisfaction ratings for weekly livestream video lectures and throughout our monthly educational modules (median ratings 9-10 out of a 10-point Likert scale). Qualitative feedback regarding specific lecture topics and educational modules were also received. Conclusions International remote education in LMICs poses a unique set of challenges to medical educators. Residents in our study reported high satisfaction with the curriculum, but there is a lack of clarity regarding how a remote curriculum may impact academic and clinical performance. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and academic and clinical implications of remote medical education in LMICs.",

The study aimed to understand the clinical characteristics of young COVID-19 patients.\n\nMaterial and methods\nNinety patients with severe COVID-19 infection in western Chongqing were collected from 21 January to 14 March 2020. They were divided into 4 groups based on age: youth (  60 years). The clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging findings, and treatment effects were compared among the groups.\n\nResults\nThere were 22, 27, 19, and 22 cases in the youth, middle-aged, middle-elderly, and elderly groups, respectively. There were no significant differences with respect to gender or smoking status among the four groups. The clinical indicators of severe disease in the youth group were significantly different from the other three groups, and included the lymphocyte count (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein level (p = 0.03), interleukin-6 level (p = 0.01), chest computed tomography (CT) findings (p < 0.001), number of mild cases (p = 0.02), education level (p < 0.001), and CD4 + T lymphocyte level (p = 0.02) at the time of admission, and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) at the time of discharge (p < 0.001). The complications (p < 0.001) among the youth group were also significantly different from the other groups.\n\nConclusions\nYoung patients have milder clinical manifestations, which may be related to higher education level, higher awareness and higher acceptance of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as their good immune function.",

This study reports on the approach and outcomes of cancer patients receiving radical surgery with curative intent between March and September 2020 (in comparison to 2019) in the European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS (IEO) in Milan and the South East London Cancer Alliance (SELCA). Both institutions implemented a COVID-19 minimal pathway where patients were required to self-isolate prior to admission and were swabbed for COVID-19 within 72 h of surgery. Positive patients had surgery deferred until a negative swab. At IEO, radical surgeries declined by 6% as compared to the same period in 2019 (<i>n</i> = 1477 vs. 1560, respectively). Readmissions were required for 3% (<i>n</i> = 41), and <1% (<i>n</i> = 9) developed COVID-19, of which only one had severe disease and died. At SELCA, radical surgeries declined by 34% (<i>n</i> = 1553 vs. 2336). Readmissions were required for 11% (<i>n</i> = 36), <1% (<i>n</i> = 7) developed COVID-19, and none died from it. Whilst a decline in number of surgeries was observed in both centres, the implemented COVID-19 minimal pathways have shown to be safe for cancer patients requiring radical treatment, with limited complications and almost no COVID-19 infections.",

Sphingolipid metabolism is a critical regulator of cell survival and pathologic inflammation processes involved in AKI. Opaganib (also known as ABC294640) is a first-in-class experimental drug targeting sphingolipid metabolism that reduces the production and activity of inflammatory cytokines and, therefore, may be effective to prevent and treat AKI.Methods: Murine models of AKI were used to assess the in vivo efficacy of opaganib including ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury induced by either transient bilateral occlusion of renal blood flow (a moderate model) or nephrectomy followed immediately by occlusion of the contralateral kidney (a severe model) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Biochemical and histologic assays were used to quantify the effects of oral opaganib treatment on renal damage in these models.Results: Opaganib suppressed the elevations of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as granulocyte infiltration into the kidneys, of mice that experienced moderate IR from transient bilateral ligation. Opaganib also markedly decreased these parameters and completely prevented mortality in the severe renal IR model. Additionally, opaganib blunted the elevations of BUN, creatinine and inflammatory cytokines following exposure to LPS.Conclusion: The data support the hypotheses that sphingolipid metabolism is a key mediator of renal inflammatory damage following IR injury and sepsis, and that this can be suppressed by opaganib. Because opaganib has already undergone clinical testing in other diseases (cancer and Covid-19), the present studies support conducting clinical trials with this drug with surgical or septic patients at risk for AKI.Keywords: opaganib, sphingosine kinase, sphingolipid, acute kidney injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, lipopolysaccharide, sepsis",

We examined types and load of stressors faced by youth, and their use of coping strategies. A population-based sample within Bergen municipality, Norway (N\u2009=\u20091031, 11\u201319\u2009years) completed the Response to Stress Questionnaire 9\u2009months into the pandemic. Social stressors were most frequent, with secondary control engagement being the most used coping strategy. Stress and coping strategies differed depending on sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Heightened stress were associated with primary and secondary control engagement, and disengagement. Thus, youth employed a range of coping strategies to an increasing degree with heightened levels of COVID-19 stress. The frequency of secondary control engagement aligns with the enduring uncontrollable nature of the outbreak. For future health crises, authorities should focus on social stressors experienced by youth, especially among girls, older youth, and youth with low socioeconomic status.",

Drawing on quantitative data gathered from 751 migrant students in secondary schools in six European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK), we examined the impact of Covid\u201019 school closures, social support, and post\u2010traumatic stress symptoms on changes in school belonging. Linear regression showed a non\u2010significant decrease in school belonging, and none of the studied variables had a significant effect on this change in our whole sample. However, sensitivity analysis on a subsample from three countries (Denmark, Finland, and the UK) showed a small but significant negative effect of increasing post\u2010traumatic stress symptoms on school belonging during Covid\u201019 school closures. Given that scholarship on school belonging during Covid\u201019 is emergent, this study delineates some key areas for future research on the relationship between wellbeing, school belonging, and inclusion.",

In this study, we purpose to identify the features of children with COVID-19 and the factors affecting disease severity.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study was conducted on patients who presented with suspicion of COVID-19 from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, at a tertiary care medical center in Turkey. The characteristics of 640 children who were confirmed to have COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were retrieved from medical records.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the cases was 10 \u00b1 6 years, and 56% of them were male. Seasonal difference did not affect the number of cases. The majority of the cases (n = 501, 78%) were infected by family members. Fever (67%) and cough (38%) were common complaints. The mean duration of fever was 1.9 \u00b1 1.1 days. One-fourth of the cases were asymptomatic, 462 (72%) had mild upper respiratory tract infections, and 18 (3%) had pneumonia. Patients with pneumonia were more likely to have comorbidities and had a longer fever duration (both P < 0.001). Fever, cough, and respiratory distress were more common in patients with pneumonia (P = 0.010, P = 0.023, and P < 0.001, respectively). The mean C-reactive protein (CRP) value of the patients with pneumonia was significantly higher than that of the others (P < 0.001). A total of 70 (11%) complicated patients were hospitalized, 5 of them requiring intensive care admission. All hospitalized patients were discharged with recovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild disease, some children with comorbidities can still develop a severe illness. CRP value is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, the prevalence rate of COVID-19 did not decrease with hot seasons.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Continuous deterministic models have been widely used to guide non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The validity of continuous deterministic models is questionable because they fail to incorporate two important characteristics of human society: high clustering and low degree of separation. A small-world network model is used to study the spread of COVID-19, thus providing more reliable information to provide guidance to mitigate it. Optimal timing of lockdown and reopening society is investigated so that intervention measures to combat COVID-19 can work more efficiently. Several important findings are listed as follows: travel restrictions should be implemented as soon as possible; if \u2018flattening the curve\u2019 is the purpose of the interventions, measures to reduce community transmission need not be very strict so that the lockdown can be sustainable; the fraction of the population that is susceptible, rather than the levels of daily new cases and deaths, is a better criterion to decide when to reopen society; and society can be safely reopened when the susceptible population is still as high as 70%, given that the basic reproduction number is 2.5. Results from small-world network models can be significantly different than those from continuous deterministic models, and the differences are mainly due to a major shortfall intrinsically embedded in the continuous deterministic models. As such, small-world network models provide meaningful improvements over continuous deterministic models and therefore should be used in the mathematical modeling of infection spread to guide the present COVID-19 interventions. For future epidemics, the present framework of mathematical modeling can be a better alternative to continuous deterministic models.",

                "abstract": "Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community responded promptly by developing effective vaccines. Still, even though effective vaccines against COVID-19 became available, many people did not seem to be in a rush to become immunized. Community protection can be enhanced if more people decide to vaccinate, and thus it is necessary to identify relevant factors involved in vaccination behavior to find better ways of encouraging it. Vaccination behavior is the result of a decision process that might vary according to individual differences in information processing. We investigated the role of cognitive reflection ability and thinking styles in predicting self-reported vaccination behavior against COVID-19. A sample of 274 Romanian participants was surveyed for the present study, out of which 217 (<i>M<sub>ag</sub></i><sub>e</sub> = 24.58, <i>SD</i> = 8.31; 53% female) declared they had the possibility to become vaccinated. Results showed that a higher level of cognitive reflection ability significantly increased the odds of becoming vaccinated. A rational thinking style was not linked to vaccination behavior. However, an experiential thinking style indirectly predicted vaccination behavior by means of attitudes towards vaccination. Since individual differences in information processing are, to a certain extent, linked to vaccination behavior, the design of vaccination campaigns could consider that people have specific information needs and address them as such.",

                "abstract": "Objective Healthcare provider (HCP) burnout is on the rise with electronic medical record (EMR) use being cited as a factor, particularly with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout in HCPs is associated with negative patient outcomes, and, therefore, it is crucial to understand and address each factor that affects HCP burnout. This study aims to (a) assess the relationship between EMR use and burnout and (b) explore interventions to reduce EMR-related burnout.Methods We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL and SCOPUS on 29 July 2021. We selected all studies in English from any publication year and country that discussed burnout in HCPs (physicians, nurse practitioners and registered nurses) related to EMR use. Studies must have reported a quantitative relationship to be included. Studies that implemented an intervention to address this burnout were also included. All titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers, and all full-text articles were reviewed by two reviewers. Any conflicts were addressed with a third reviewer and resolved through discussion. Quality of evidence of all included articles was assessed using the Quality Rating Scheme for Studies and Other Evidence.Findings The search identified 563 citations with 416 citations remaining after duplicate removal. A review of abstracts led to 59 studies available for full-text assessment, resulting in 25 studies included in the scoping review. Commonly identified associations between EMR-related burnout in HCPs included: message and alert load, time spent on EMRs, organisational support, EMR functionality and usability and general use of EMRs. Two articles employed team-based interventions to improve burnout symptoms without significant improvement in burnout scores.Conclusions and relevance Current literature supports an association between EMR use and provider burnout. Very limited evidence exists for burnout-reducing interventions that address factors such as time spent on EMRs, organisational support or EMR design.",

                "abstract": "Starting from 2020 to the present day, because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the sphere of tourism and hotel industry, as well as in related areas, there has been a decline or even complete cessation of activity, as a result of which a significant number of enterprises have become bankrupt or in crisis. So there is a need to find such a way of development of the spheres of tourism and hospitality, which would provide an opportunity not only to preserve these areas, but also to provide, after leaving the pandemic, the conditions for their further development in such a manner that as many as possible business entities are involved in their activities. It is also necessary to take into account the demand of people \u2013 potential recreants (tourists and vacationers), which should be satisfied, despite the pandemic, because during isolation and restrictions in movement and communication with nature, a depressed and painful state occurs, which leads to a deterioration in efficiency and a decrease in the number of able-bodied personnel. As an instrument to overcome the existing crisis, it is proposed to create campsites with the involvement of all stakeholders from enterprises in the sphere of tourism, hotel and other industries. Such an approach makes it possible to work during a pandemic due to the lack of crowding in one place. At the same time, thanks to the differentiated approach when creating campsites, it is possible to satisfy the maximum possible range of demand from potential tourists and vacationers by creating conditions of stay that are different in comfort. As for the possibility of working not only during a pandemic, but also after its completion, camping is best suited for this, since when it is created, a stable entrepreneurial managed structure is formed \u2013 a territorial recreational system that becomes the core for the further development of tourism, hotel industry and other areas directly or indirectly related to their activities.",

The data were obtained from the single electronic database of registered cases of COVID-19. All data were analyzed using a logistic regression in STATA 17.0 software. Further, the matched case-control study was performed for patients with type 2 DM and no DM based on age, gender, and BMI.RESULTS: Of the 5023 analyzed subjects, 72.63% had no diabetes mellitus (DM), 4.24% had type 1 DM, 15.19% had type 2 DM, and 7.94% was diagnosed with DM during the COVID-19 infection. DM, overweight, and obesity were associated with severe COVID-19; the most significant risk of a severe course was found in persons with type 2 DM. The risk of a lethal outcome and the need for prescription of glucocorticoids did not show a significant association with diabetes in Tashkent. The clinical features of COVID-19 were more common in patients with type 2 DM, especially for shortness of breath, chest pain, and arrhythmia. The persons receiving SU have complained of dyspnea significantly more often than matched patients without DM. Metformin and DPP4i were the groups of drugs that were not associated with significantly increased risk of hospitalization of patients because of COVID-19. The matched case-control study did not reveal statistically significant differences in the disease course severity, need for hospitalization and glucocorticoids, and death depending on the glucose-lowering therapy preceding the onset of COVID-19.CONCLUSION: Diabetes, age and overweight/obesity were associated with severe course of COVID-19 in Tashkent. There was no statistical difference in COVID-19 severity depending on initial glucose-lowering therapy.",

                "abstract": "Mathematical modeling plays an important role to better understand the disease dynamics and designing strategies to manage quickly spreading infectious diseases in lack of an effective vaccine or specific antivirals. During this period, forecasting is of utmost priority for health care planning and to combat COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we proposed and extended classical SEIR compartment model refined by contact tracing and hospitalization strategies to explain the COVID-19 outbreak. We calibrated our model with daily COVID-19 data for the five provinces of India namely, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and the overall India. To identify the most effective parameters we conduct a sensitivity analysis by using the partial rank correlation coefficients techniques. The value of those sensitive parameters were estimated from the observed data by least square method. We performed sensitivity analysis for R0to investigate the relative importance of the system parameters. Also, we computed the sensitivity indices for R0to determine the robustness of the model predictions to parameter values. Our study demonstrates that a critically important strategy can be achieved by reducing the disease transmission coefficient \u03b2sand clinical outbreak rate qato control the COVID-19 outbreaks. Performed short-term predictions for the daily and cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 outbreak for all the five provinces of India and the overall India exhibited the steady exponential growth of some states and other states showing decays of daily new cases. Long-term predictions for the Republic of India reveals that the COVID-19 cases will exhibit oscillatory dynamics. Our research thus leaves the option open that COVID-19 might become a seasonal disease. Our model simulation demonstrates that the COVID-19 cases across India at the end of September 2020 obey a power law.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The development of rapid antigen tests has contributed to easing the burden on healthcare and lifting restrictions by detecting infected individuals to help prevent further transmission of the virus. We developed a state-of-art rapid antigen testing system, named DIAGNOVIR, based on immune-fluorescence analysis, which can process and give the results in a minute. In our study, we assessed the performance of the DIAGNOVIR and compared the results with those of the qRT-PCR test. Our results demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of the DIAGNOVIR were 94% and 99.2%, respectively, with a 100% sensitivity and 96.97% specificity, among asymptomatic patients. In addition, DIAGNOVIR can detect SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 with 100% sensitivity up to 5\u00a0days after symptom onset. We observed that the DIAGNOVIR Rapid Antigen Test\u2019s limit of detection (LoD) was not significantly affected by the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 variants including Wuhan, alpha (B1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants, and LoD was calculated as 8\u2009\u00d7\u2009102, 6.81\u2009\u00d7\u2009101.5, 3.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009101.5, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009103, and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009103.5 TCID50/mL, respectively. Our results indicated that DIAGNOVIR can detect all SARS-CoV-2 variants in just seconds with higher sensitivity and specificity lower testing costs and decreased turnover time.",

However, past favorable associations of statins to pre-COVID-19 infection outcomes (also buttressed by theoretical benefits) were unsupported in meta-analysis of RCTs, RR = 1.00. Initial RCTs in COVID-19 appear to follow this trajectory. Healthy-user/tolerator effects and indication bias may explain these disparities. Moreover, cholesterol drops in proportion to infection severity, so less severely affected individuals may be selected for statin use, contributing to apparent favorable statin associations to outcomes. Cholesterol transports fat-soluble antioxidants and immune-protective vitamins. Statins impair mitochondrial function in those most reliant on coenzyme Q10 (a mevalonate pathway product also transported on cholesterol)\u2014i.e., those with existing mitochondrial compromise, whom data suggest bear increased risks from both COVID-19 and from statins. Thus, statin risks of adverse outcomes are amplified in those patients at risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes\u2014i.e., those in whom adjunctive statin therapy may most likely be given. High reported rates of rhabdomyolysis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients underscore the notion that statin-related risks as well as benefits must be considered. Advocacy for statins in COVID-19 should be suspended pending clear evidence of RCT benefits, with careful attention to risk modifiers.",

With the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, educational institutions were forced to migrate to digital platforms to ensure the continuity of the imparted lectures. The online approach can be challenging for engineering programs, especially in courses that employ practical laboratory methods as the primary teaching strategies. Laboratory courses that include specialized hardware and software cannot migrate to a virtual environment without compromising the advantages that a hands-on method provides to the engineering student. This work assesses different approaches in the virtualization process of a laboratory facility, diving these into key factors such as required communication infrastructure and available technologies; it opens a discussion on the trends and possible obstacles in the virtualization of a Real-Time (RT) laboratory intended for Microgrid education in a power electronics laboratory course, exposing the main simulation strategies that can be used in an RT environment and how these have different effects on the learning process of student, as well as addressing the main competencies an engineering student can strengthen through interaction with RT simulation technologies.",

A total of 272 plasma samples collected in the period November\u2013December 2021 were analyzed by the methods Simoa SARS CoV\u20102 N Protein Advantage Kit [Quanterix Simoa], Solsten SARS-CoV-2 Antigen enzyme immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [Solsten ELISA], and Elecsys SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Antigen electrochemiluminescence immunoassay [Elecsys ECLIA]. Additionally, a dilution series of inactivated virus culture was analyzed by the three assays. The SARS CoV-2 PCR-status was not known for the patients. Linear correlation in the pairwise correlation between assays as well as linearity of dilution series of inactivated virus culture was estimated by Spearman score. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated by pairwise comparison. The three assays showed poor agreement on patient samples with regards to concentration. Performance on virus culture was excellent but with different level of detection (LOD). Positive vs negative results show comparable sensitivity and specificity of Quanterix Simoa and Solsten ELISA, with a higher LOD in Elecsys ECLIA and thus lower sensitivity and high specificity. N by all tested assays can be used as a marker for systemic COVID-19 disease.",

Some studies stated that CT was more sensitive\r\ndiagnostic modality for COVID-19 than RT-PCR. However, the\r\nsensitivity of CT for COVID-19 varies in these studies.\r\nAim: This literature review and meta-analysis was designed to\r\ndetermine the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia, to verify the\r\npooled sensitivity of CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to\r\nreview the different reasons (e.g., the disease stage or severity\r\nand the negative or positive RT-PCR results) for the variations\r\nin CT sensitivity.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This review analysed 31 articles\r\nselected from the Europe BMC, PubMed, Science Direct, and\r\nScopus databases. Participant gender mean and median age, CT\r\nfeatures of COVID-19 pneumonia were sought for and reviewed.\r\nThe data was analysed using Microsoft excel version 10 and\r\nOpenMeta (Analyst) software (http://www.cebm.brown.edu/\r\nopenmeta/) to verify the pooled sensitivity of CT in detection and\r\ndiagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia using meta-analyses forest\r\nplot, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, cumulative\r\nmeta-analyses forest plot and leave one forest plot.\r\nResults: The most common CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia\r\nwere bilateral lung involvement, Ground Glass Opacity (GGO),\r\nand consolidation, and Crazy-paving pattern. The CT finding\r\nis more prominent in symptomatic and severe cases than in\r\na symptomatic and mild cases specifically the presence of\r\nconsolidation and peripherals lesion distribution. The pooled\r\nsensitivity of CT is 90% in diagnosis and detection of COVID19 pneumonia (ranged 60-100%).\r\nConclusion: Combination of CT chest and laboratory tests\r\nalong with clinical manifestation and epidemiological features\r\nshould be considered to confirm the final diagnosis of COVID19 pneumonia.",

In patients with COVID-19, especially with a severe course of the disease, a decrease in the quantitative composition of the main populations of lymphocytes is recorded. These indicators do not recover for a long time after recovery. However, it is still not known how long the quantitative and qualitative changes in the composition of lymphocytes will last and whether the severity of the infection affects this process. The aim of our study was to assess the quantitative and qualitative composition of the main populations and subpopulations of lymphocytes in patients with a new coronavirus infection of varying severity. 65 patients with a new coronavirus infection were examined. The average age of the subjects was 47.314.5 years. The volunteers were divided into three groups according to the severity of the infection: asymptomatic (n = 21); moderate (n = 32); severe (n = 12). The relative and absolute number of T-lymphocytes (CD3+), T-helper cells (CD3+CD4+), cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+), natural killers (CD3CD16+CD56+), TNK-lymphocytes (CD3+CD16CD56+) and B-lymphocytes (CD45+CD19+) were determined. To calculate the percentage of lymphocytes, whole blood was lysed with OPTILYSE C solution (Beckman Coulter, USA) and stained with monoclonal antibodies CD3+-FITC/CD8+-ECD/CD4+-PC5/CD16+CD56+PE and CD45+-Pacific Blue/CD19+-PC5 (Beckman Coulter, USA). Cytofluorometry was performed on a flow cytofluorometer Navios (Beckman Coulter, USA). The results of our studies showed that there were no statistically significant changes in the relative and absolute number of immunocompetent cells in asymptomatic patients with a new coronavirus infection, compared with the control group. With an average severity of the disease, a decrease in the relative and absolute content of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes was revealed, these indicators were restored to control values six months after recovery. In patients with severe infection, there was a decrease in the relative and absolute number of T cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes. These values remained significantly below normal for six months and returned to normal only seven to eight months after recovery. Also, the volunteers of this group were found to have a decrease in the number of natural killers and TNK cells. Thus, the data obtained by us indicate that pathological changes concerning the relative and absolute number of the main populations and subpopulations of lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 depend on the severity of the disease. The number of T-lymphocytes, cytotoxic lymphocytes, natural killer cells, that is, populations of cells that play a crucial role in effective antiviral protection, has been reduced in those who have undergone a new coronavirus infection in moderate and severe form. This information can be useful for expanding methodological approaches to the diagnosis, treatment of a new coronavirus infection, as well as measures for the rehabilitation of those who have suffered it.",

Most studies have not shown favorable results for many of these drugs, but they are still used. The aim as to determine the differences and similarities in the hospital pharmacological management of patients with COVID-19 according to sex, age group, and geographical region of Colombia, 2020\u20132021. Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on the prescription patterns of the medications given to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in eight clinics in Colombia between 6 March 2020 and 31 May 2021. We performed a descriptive analysis of the sociodemographic, clinical, and pharmacological variables of the patients. A total of 8596 patients from 170 cities were identified, with a median age of 53.0 years and 53.3% of them men. A total of 24.3% required care in the intensive care unit, and 18.7% required invasive mechanical ventilation. The most commonly used drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 were systemic corticosteroids (63.6%), followed by colchicine (12.8%), azithromycin (8.9%), and ivermectin (6.4%). Corticosteroids, anticoagulants, colchicine, azithromycin, ivermectin, and hydroxychloroquine were prescribed more frequently in men, and their overall use increased with age. There were differences in prescriptions between geographic regions. The majority of patients were managed with medications included in the management guidelines. There were differences between sexes, age groups, and geographical regions.",

                "abstract": "The current global political, economic, and social challenges urge the need to cultivate global citizenship among students in their learning process. This paper presents the role of Collaboration Online International Learning (COIL) using the\nProject-Based Learning (PBL) approach in cultivating global citizenship among university students. The paper explains the different implementation challenges of a COIL course on the different levels and core design elements of the COIL-PBL model to overcome such challenges. Empirically, this paper presents a primary case study of the Great Debates course that was implemented in different forms by three partner universities, which are the University of Washington Bothell (UWB), the University of North Carolina Asheville (UNCA) in the USA, and the Future University in Egypt (FUE). The implementation showed a positive impact on cultivating global citizenship among participating students, which is\nclear from developments in students\u2019 skills in the areas of cross-cultural communication and negotiation, cultural sensitivity and tolerance, teamwork and coordination across virtual global teams, analytical skills, and perception toward other cultures and society. Notably, the COIL-PBL model has started to gain further popularity after the COVID-19\npandemic as an alternative for physical mobility, which encourages future research in this area using other implemented courses using the COIL-PBL model.",

                "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between information commerce usage and purchase decisions made by university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nDesign/Methodology/Approach \u2013 Survey questionnaires were distributed to students at public and private universities through a variety of online platforms. Data was collected from 151 respondents within a two-week period and analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26 for descriptive (i.e., mean, standard deviation, reliability test, model fit test) and inferential (i.e., correlation and regression for hypotheses testing) purposes.\r\nFindings and implications \u2013 The findings indicate that, while students engage in information commerce for its convenience, their usage of it is unrelated to the degree of trust. Nonetheless, price comparison has a sizable influence on how information commerce is used. Additionally, information commerce usage has an effect on purchase intention, while purchase intention is found to be a significant predictor of purchase decisions.\r\nLimitation \u2013 This study examined factors that influence the usage of information commerce among students in Malaysian universities, as well as their purchase intention, on a rather small sample size.\r\nOriginality \u2013 This may be the first study to define information commerce usage, with its results confirming students\u2019 purchase behavior and demonstrating that online shopping simplifies their lives. Surprisingly, the findings suggest that the degree of trust does not influence the usage of information commerce. This contradicts previous studies conducted by Anas et al. (2021) and Viktoria et al. (2021).",

                "abstract": "Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions posed challenges to maintaining healthy lifestyles and physical well-being. During the first mobility restrictions from March to mid-July 2020, the German population was advised to stay home, except for work, exercise, and essential shopping. Our objective was to comprehensively assess the impact of these restrictions on changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior to identify the most affected groups. Methods Between April 30, 2020, and May 12, 2020, we distributed a COVID-19-specific questionnaire to participants of the German National Cohort (NAKO). This questionnaire gathered information about participants\u2019 physical activity and sedentary behavior currently compared to the time before the restrictions. We integrated this new data with existing information on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and physical activity. The analyses focused on sociodemographic factors, social relationships, physical health, and working conditions. Results Out of 152,421 respondents, a significant proportion reported altered physical activity and sedentary behavioral patterns due to COVID-19 restrictions. Over a third of the participants initially meeting the WHO\u2019s physical activity recommendation could no longer meet the guidelines during the restrictions. Participants reported substantial declines in sports activities (mean change (M)\u2009=\u2009-0.38; 95%\u00a0CI: -.390; -.378; range from -2 to\u2009+\u20092) and reduced active transportation (M\u2009=\u2009-0.12; 95%\u00a0CI: -.126; -.117). However, they also increased recreational physical activities (M\u2009=\u20090.12; 95%\u00a0CI: .117; .126) while engaging in more sedentary behavior (M\u2009=\u20090.24; 95%\u00a0CI: .240; .247) compared to pre-restriction levels. Multivariable linear and log-binomial regression models indicated that younger adults were more affected by the restrictions than older adults. The shift to remote work, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms were the factors most strongly associated with changes in all physical activity domains, including sedentary behavior, and the likelihood to continue following the physical activity guidelines. Conclusions Mobility patterns shifted towards inactivity or low-intensity activities during the nationwide restrictions in the spring of 2020, potentially leading to considerable and lasting health risks.",

                "abstract": "Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are rare but potentially lethal tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla. The clinical suspicion and diagnosis of PCC can be challenging due to the non-specific nature of signs and symptoms. In many patients, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could lead to long-term symptoms including fatigue, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction. Here, we present the case of a patient incidentally diagnosed with an adrenal mass that proved to be a PCC after imaging was performed due to persisting complaints after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. A 37-year-old male patient was referred to our center because of a right-sided inhomogeneous adrenal mass, incidentally found during a computed tomographic scan of the thorax performed due to cough and dyspnea that persisted after COVID-19 infection. Other complaints that were present prior to COVID-19 infection included profuse sweating, dizziness, exhaustion with chronic fatigue, and concentration difficulties. The patient had no history of hypertension, his blood pressure was normal, and the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed normotension but with the absence of nocturnal dipping. Plasma normetanephrine was 5.7-fold above the upper limit (UL) of reference intervals (738 pg/ml, UL = 129 pg/ml), whereas plasma metanephrine and methoxytyramine were normal at 30 pg/ml (UL = 84 pg/ml) and &lt;4 pg/ml (UL = 16 pg/ml), respectively. Preoperative preparation with phenoxybenzamine was initiated, and a 4-cm tumor was surgically resected. Profuse sweating as well as dizziness was resolved after adrenalectomy pointing toward PCC and not COVID-19-associated patient concerns. Altogether, this case illustrates the difficulties in recognizing the possibility of PCC due to the non-specific nature of signs and symptoms of the tumor, which in this case did not include hypertension and coincided with some of the symptoms of long COVID-19.",

                "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has, as of July 2022, infected more than 550 million people and caused over 6 million deaths across the world. COVID-19 vaccines were quickly developed to protect against severe disease, hospitalization and death. In the present study, we performed a direct comparative analysis of four COVID-19 vaccines: BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen), following primary and booster vaccination. We focused on the vaccine-induced antibody-mediated immune response against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants: wildtype, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron). The analysis included the quantification of total IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, as well as the quantification of antibody neutralization titers. Furthermore, the study assessed the high-throughput ACE2 competition assay as a surrogate for the traditional pseudovirus neutralization assay. The results demonstrated marked differences in antibody-mediated immune responses. The lowest Spike-specific IgG levels and antibody neutralization titers were induced by one dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, intermediate levels by two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and the highest levels by two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine or heterologous vaccination of one dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine and a subsequent mRNA vaccine. The study also demonstrated that accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mutations was accompanied by a marked decline in antibody neutralization capacity, especially for B.1.1.529. Administration of a booster dose was shown to significantly increase Spike-specific IgG levels and antibody neutralization titers, erasing the differences between the vaccine-induced antibody-mediated immune response between the four vaccines. The findings of this study highlight the importance of booster vaccines and the potential inclusion of future heterologous vaccination strategies for broad protection against current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

In the past months, hospitals were saturated of patients; therefore, it is still important to have simple and standardized prognostic factors and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of medications commonly used for COVID-19. We aimed to collect data of the patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine and Geriatrics Wards at the University Hospital (Policlinico) \u2018P. Giaccone\u2019 in Palermo, Italy (COMEPA, COVID-19 Medicina Policlinico Palermo), with the main purpose of finding prognostic tools that can be easily used in clinical practice in order to identify patients hospitalized for/with COVID-19 at higher risk of negative outcomes, such as mortality, transfer to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and institutionalization, as well as evaluating the efficacy/safety of medications commonly used for COVID-19. For reaching these aims, the medical records of approximately 600 patients will be recorded, having data on several parameters and including as outcomes mortality, ICU placement, institutionalization. With the COMEPA study, we therefore plan to update current literature, giving new data on prognostic factors and on the efficacy/safety of some medications used for COVID-19.",
